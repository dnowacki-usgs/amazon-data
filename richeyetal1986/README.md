# Reproduction of Richey et al. 1986 Table 3

This is a digitized version of Table 3, "Distributions of Discharge, Fine Suspended Sediments, and Coarse Suspended Sediments Over CAMREX Cruises 1 to 8" from Richey, J. E., Meade, R. H., Salati, E., Devol, A. H., Nordin, C. F., & dos Santos, U. (1986). Water Discharge and Suspended Sediment Concentrations in the Amazon River: 1982-1984. Water Resources Research, 22(5), 756â€“764. [doi:10.1029/WR022i005p00756](https://doi.org/10.1029/WR022i005p00756)

In the files, values of `nan` correspond to "..." in the original table. Values of `tr` indicate "trace." Some values in the Discharge table were estimated or determined from stage-discharge relationships; these are not noted as such in this version but are in the PDF.
